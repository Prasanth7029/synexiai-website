# 🧠 Inventory Management System – A Microservices Case Study

At SynexiAI, we believe real innovation happens when strong architecture meets meaningful functionality. Our **Inventory Management System** is a full-stack microservices-based application that showcases how we architect scalable, secure, and modern platforms from scratch.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture Overview

The system follows **microservices architecture**, where each core functionality is separated into independently deployable Spring Boot services:

- **User Service**: Handles authentication (JWT), signup, login, and role-based access (Admin, Warehouse Staff).
- **Inventory Service**: Manages product CRUD operations, stock levels, SKU validation, and caching.
- **Order Service**: Places and manages orders, integrates with Inventory and User services, and deducts stock.
- **Notification Service**: Sends **email alerts** for low stock or successful order confirmations.
- **Audit Log Service**: Tracks important events like login, order placement, and inventory changes in **MongoDB**.

All services communicate securely using **REST APIs** (initially), and **RabbitMQ** (event-driven async messaging) is being integrated for scalable notifications and audit logging.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- Java 17 + Spring Boot (Microservices)
- Spring Security + JWT
- RabbitMQ (async events)
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- JPA, RESTTemplate, Validation
- JUnit + Mockito (unit & integration tests)

**Frontend:**
- React + Vite
- Axios with JWT Interceptor
- Context API for global auth/session
- Responsive Dashboard with Tailwind CSS
- Charts (Bar/Doughnut) for stock/order insights

**DevOps & Infra:**
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD for future)
- Docker (coming soon)
- GitHub Pages (Frontend hosting)

## 🔐 Authentication & Role-Based Access

- **Spring Security** is implemented with custom JWT filters.
- Role-based authorization ensures that:
    - Admins can manage all modules.
    - Warehouse Staff can only view/update stock and fulfill orders.

## 📦 Inventory Module Features

- Add/update/delete/view inventory
- Search by SKU or name
- View stock level, category, threshold
- Caching with `@Cacheable`
- Validation for inputs and data integrity

## 📑 Order Management

- Create orders after checking stock
- Deduct inventory in real-time
- Fetch order history by user or admin
- RabbitMQ-based notification published

## 📬 Notifications & Emails

- Custom email templates for:
    - Low stock warnings
    - Order success confirmations
- Future plan: migrate email logic to **async queues (RabbitMQ)**

## 📊 Dashboard UI Highlights

- Recent orders and stock alerts
- Interactive bar/doughnut charts
- Quick actions for admin/staff
- Auth-protected views with session token

## 🛡️ Testing & Security

- Unit tests using JUnit/Mockito
- Integration tests for all core flows
- CSRF disabled for stateless JWT API
- CORS properly configured for `localhost:5173`

## 🔮 What’s Next?

We’re continuously improving the platform:
- ✅ Full audit logging via MongoDB
- 🚧 Integrating RabbitMQ for async flow
- 🔐 API Gateway and Service Registry (Spring Cloud)
- 📦 Dockerize all services for deployment
- 🌍 Deploy to Render / Railway / AWS / Fly.io
